# LLM-App-With-Python-Using-OpenAI-API-And-

This repository contains a custom user interface (UI) for ChainLit LLM, powered by the ChainLit LLM engine. The UI provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the language model and generate human-like text.

## Features
- Interactive text generation: Engage in dynamic conversations with ChainLit LLM.
- Prompt-based input: Provide initial prompts to guide the generated responses.
- Customization options: Fine-tune the output by adjusting parameters such as temperature.
- Error handling: Gracefully handle errors and display appropriate error messages.
  
## Prerequisites
To run the ChainLit LLM Custom UI, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- ChainLit LLM engine installed. (Refer to the ChainLit LLM documentation for installation instructions.)
- 
## Getting Started
To get started with the ChainLit LLM Custom UI, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/VigneshwaranBS/LLM-App-With-Python-Using-OpenAI-API-And-ChainLit.git
```
Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the UI:
```
chainlit run chainlit.py -w
```
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to access the ChainLit LLM Custom UI.

## Usage
- Enter your prompt in the input field provided.
- Adjust the temperature and max tokens sliders to customize the output (optional).
- Click the "Generate" button to initiate text generation.
- View the generated response in the output section.
- 
## Customization
The ChainLit LLM Custom UI allows you to customize the following parameters:

- Temperature: Controls the randomness of the generated text. Higher values (e.g., 1.0) produce more diverse but potentially less coherent responses, while lower values (e.g., 0.5) produce more focused and conservative responses.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the ChainLit LLM Custom UI, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Make sure you have the ChainLit LLM engine installed and configured correctly.
Check that all dependencies are installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Verify that the Python version is compatible with the ChainLit LLM Custom UI.
Ensure that the necessary port (default: 5000) is not blocked by any firewall or security settings.
If the issue persists, please consult the ChainLit LLM documentation or open an issue in this repository for further assistance.
